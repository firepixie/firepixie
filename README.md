### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Erin St Blaine is a fashion and LED artist based in California. Her work explores the melding of microcontrollers and wearable technology with dance and live performance. She works with Adafruit.com to create art and tutorials for DIY electronics.

Erin's innovative creations explore the way LED lights and 3d printed objects interact with the human body in motion: onstage through dance and flow arts, connecting with audiences at events through interactive character costumes, or underwater with Glimmer, the world's first fully submersible and swimmable LED mermaid tail.

Her mission is to inspire more young makers, especially girls who are under-represented in the STEM world, to use art and technology to make their own dreams come true.
